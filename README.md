- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saifur7599 - Teacher of Chemistry in UK
- 👀 I’m interested in regenerating flash files that were embedded in PowerPoints in the 1990 and early 2000s back into .swf files and eventually converting them into HTML 5.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and using Ruffle. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on chemistry education content that has interactive component element embedding them back into PowerPoint.
